	<h1> Peter Principle
	</h1>
	<p> The Peter Principle states that, if you perform well in your job, you will likely be promoted to the next level of your
		organization's hierarchy. You will continue to rise up the ladder until you reach the point where you can no longer perform
		well.

	<h1> Shirky Principle
	</h1>
	<p>“Institutions will try to pserve the problem to which they are the solution.” — Clay Shirky
	</p>
	<p>Sometimes this may manifest itself as blindness towards new or different ways of doing things, other times it’s the challenge
		of and innate resistance to making oneself obsolete. Examples include there being more money in life-long illnesses than
		cures, traditional newspapers’ resistance to alternative online news forms, planned obsolescence of products, committees
		requiring the psence of committees, or resistance to self-checkouts at a supermarket.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some exceptions include Vitality health insurance in the UK that rewards a healthy lifestyle, and the lightbulb industry,
		in its move towards ultra long-lasting and efficient LED lights, boldly eliminating the need to replace most of its products
		for a lifetime. I’m still waiting for a breakdown service to reward people for taking care of their cars rather than focusing
		on fixing the breakdowns.</p>

  <div id="ML">
	<h1> Moore's Law
	</h1>
	<p>Moore's Law refers to Moore's perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, though
		the cost of computers is halved. Moore's Law states that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase
		every couple of years, and we will pay less for them.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="RI">
	<h1> Roth IRA
	</h1>
	<p>An IRA is a similar account, except that an employer doesn't contribute into it, but you don't have to be employed to
		open one. Anyone can open an IRA and start depositing money. Some IRAs require a minimum starting balance, but many waive
		those if you do automatic deposits from your paycheck. As with 401ks, there are standard IRAs and Roth IRAs (there are
		also Roth 401ks that work with the same principle). With a standard IRA/401k, the money you deposit is taken out as p-tax
		money. The advantage is that you can deposit more money into your account (since you're not losing 20-30% for taxes). However,
		when you take the money out, it will be taxed as earned income (if you live in a state that doesn't have income tax, you'll
		still pay federal taxes).
